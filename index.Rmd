# **Welcome to My Lab Journal**

This is the documentation of my work in the NIT Data Science course in the summer semester 2020. Over the course of the semester, I will use this website to display my progress in learning R for business analytics. 

## Self-Introduction

Hi, 

my name is Milena, currently living in Cologne to work as a Digital Strategy Consultant at IBM while studying Technology Management at the NIT in Hamburg. Before joining the NIT I did my bachelor's in business administration at the university of Mannheim and worked in Marketing.

In my free time I love to read, party and travel. I already lived one year in India during my voluntary social year, half a year in South Korea (semester abroad) and have visited many other countries as a tourist. 

## My Motivation for Data Science

At work, I try to become an expert for AI-related solutions and currently also engage in a global quantum computing community. For both having a basic understanding about Data Science is really helpful. Additionally, I already am in the progress of teaching myself Python, so I hope that this course actually ties all these interests together.
